            <div class="para1">Steve Smith attended the post-win media interaction 
                and was asked about the CWC 2023 edition's current top two teams,
                 i.e. India and South Africa. Rohit Sharma's India and Temba Bavuma-led Proteas
                  have 10 and eight points, respectively, and look set to
                 seal their place in the semi-finals sooner than later.
                  Thus, the right-hander was all praise for India and the Proteas.</div>
    <div class="para2">Meanwhile, Australia, now with a Net Run Rate of +1.142
        , are also catching up. 
        They remain at the fourth spot, one below New Zealand.</div>
        <div class="para3">At the post-match presentation, Aussie skipper Cummins said,
             "Really happy, complete game. To put 400 on board and then defend well,
              couldn't be happier. Crazy innings. </div>
              <div class="para4">Fantastic innings, the cleanest hitting I've seen.
                 We played the style we liked to. Pleased with Smithy getting runs. 
                 We were aiming for powerplay wickets, bowled quite well without a lot of luck
                 . Zamps with another four-fer. They (New Zealand) are a really good side..
                  Big game in Dharamsala. It's the World Cup and we are in a good space,
                   can't wait to get there.</div>
                   <div class="para5">MS Dhoni recently attended an event where he once again dropped 
                    a big hint that he will play in IPL 2024. The interviewer addressed Dhoni as
                     a retired cricketer to which Dhoni said that he has only retired 
                     from international cricket.</div>
                     <div class="para6">Meanwhile, people like MS Dhoni are rare. In a world where people 
                        are so much into social media and publicity, Dhoni stays away from the 
                        limelight despite being the biggest brand in the country. </div>
                        <div class="para7">He never brags about his achievements and keeps his feet on 
                            the ground despite winning everything in life. He is an
                             inspiration to everyone who wants to be a good human being. </div>
